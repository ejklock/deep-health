/**
 * Ecosystem Runtime Container — types
 *
 * The seam through which an ecosystem plugin's CLI (`npm`, `pip`, `composer`, `php`,
 * etc.) runs in an ephemeral Docker container. A single `EcosystemRuntimeSpec` per
 * ecosystem captures everything that varies; the runtime module owns everything
 * that doesn't (retry, host-gateway, platform resolution, host-only command routing,
 * dry-run shortcut, streaming dispatch, error handling).
 *
 * Adding a new ecosystem = ship one `EcosystemRuntimeSpec` on its plugin. No new
 * provisioner class, no new executor class, no edits to the orchestrator.
 *
 * See CONTEXT.md for vocabulary, ADR-0001 for why this is docker-only.
